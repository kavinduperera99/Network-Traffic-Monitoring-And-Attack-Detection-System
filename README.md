# Network-Traffic-Monitoring-And-Attack-Detection-System
This project focuses on the development of a real-time network traffic monitoring and attack detection system using tcpdump, Prometheus, and Grafana. As cyber threats such as DDoS and port scanning evolve, there is a critical need for transparent monitoring tools. The investigation utilized a "Capture-Collect-Visualize" methodology where raw packets were captured via tcpdump, metrics were aggregated using Prometheus, and real-time behavioral data was visualized through Grafana. The findings demonstrated that by monitoring specific statistical features such as SYN/ACK ratios and connection entropy, administrators can manually identify malicious traffic patterns without relying on complex machine learning models. The system successfully provided low-latency alerts during simulated attacks, proving it to be a viable security solution for traditional network environments.
